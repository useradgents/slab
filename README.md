# Slab

In house building, a slab is what's just over the foundations. So Slab is an overlay to Foundation, extending common types and providing convenience methods and common third-party dependencies.

It also provides two tools described in [Useradgentsâ€™ iOS Architecture Guide](about:) : the Version Wizard, and the Environment Manager (with its associated Configuration Encryptor).


## Dependencies

Slab automatically adds common dependencies to your project:

- [RNCryptor](https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor) (MIT Licence) â€” AES encryption/decryption
- [KeychainSwift](https://github.com/evgenyneu/keychain-swift) (MIT Licence) â€” Swifty Keychain handling
- [Reachability](https://github.com/ashleymills/Reachability.swift) (MIT Licence) â€” Swifty replacement for Appleâ€™s Reachability, with closures

## Foundation Extensions

### Array.swift, Collection.swift, Sequence.swift

- **Extension on `Array`:**

    `func removing(at: Index) -> Array`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Returns a copy of the Array with the nth Element removed

    `func appending(_: Element) -> Array`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Returns a copy of the Array with the given Element appended
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
- **Extension on `Collection`:**

    `var isNotEmpty: Bool`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A boolean value indicating the collection is **not** empty
        

- **Extension on `Optional<Collection>`:**

    `var isEmpty: Bool`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A Boolean value indicating whether the optional is nil or the wrapped collection is empty.

    `var isNotEmpty: Bool`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A Boolean value indicating whether the wrappd collection is neither nil nor empty.

    `var nilIfEmpty: Bool`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Collapses an empty wrapped collection into a nil

    `var count: Int`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The count of the wrapped collection, or zero if the optional is nil

- **Extension on `Collection<Identifiable>`:**  

    `subscript(id: Element.ID) -> Element?`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Access identifiable elements by subscripting their id


### Codable.swift
- Provides both `JSONEncoder.shared` and `JSONDecoder.shared` (with no customization).

- **Extension on `JSONDecoder`:**

     `decode<T>(_: T.Type, at: URL) throws -> T where T : Decodable`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Decodes an instance of the indicated type from data at the given URL

- **Extension on `JSONEncoder`:**

    `encode<T>(_: T, to: URL) throws where T: Encodable`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Encodes an instance of the indicated type and writes it to the given URL


### Date.swift, DateComponents.swift, DateFormatter.swift

 Notably, these extensions allow creating DateComponents by writing
 
    1.year.and(1.week)
 
 Or creating past/future Date by writing
 
    18.months.ago
    1.year.and(2.months).fromNow
    Date.tomorrow >> 3.hours


- **New protocol**

    `protocol Dated`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â All types adhering to this protocol have a `date: Date` instance variable.

- **Extension on `Date`:**

    `func progress(between: Date, and: Date) -> Double`  
    `func progress(in: ClosedRange<Date>) -> Double`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Returns the fraction of time elapsed between two dates, as a Double in the range `0...1`

    `var dmy: DateComponents`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Returns the day, month and year components of the Date

    `var isPast: Bool`  
    `var isFuture: Bool`  
    `var isToday: Bool`  
    `var isTomorrow: Bool`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Returns boolean values stating whether the Date is past, future, today or tomorrow (according the current Calendar)

Â Â Â Â `var midnight: Date`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Returns a Date set to the beginning of its day (by setting hour, minute and second components to zero, according to the current Calendar)

Â Â Â Â `var timeIntervalSinceMidnight: TimeInterval`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Returns the timeInterval since midnight, according to the current Calendar.

Â Â Â Â **Getting common dates:**  
Â Â Â Â `static var midnight: Date`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Returns a Date set to the beginning of the current day, according to the current Calendar

Â Â Â Â `static var tomorrow: Date`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Returns a Date set to the beginning of tomorrow, according to the current Calendar

Â Â Â Â `static var yesterday: Date`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Returns a Date set to the beginning of yesterday, according to the current Calendar

Â Â Â Â `static var timeIntervalSinceMidnight: TimeInterval`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Returns the timeInterval of the beginning of the current day, according to the current Calendar

- **Extension on `ClosedRange<Date>`:**

Â Â Â Â `var isPresent: Bool`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Returns a Bool indicating whether the Date range contains the current Date

Â Â Â Â `var isPast: Bool`  
Â Â Â Â `var isFuture: Bool`    
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Return a Bool indicating whether the Date range is *entirely* in the past or in the future

- **Operators:**

Â Â Â Â `Date >> TimeInterval -> Date`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Adds a TimeInterval to a Date

Â Â Â Â `Date << TimeInterval -> Date`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Subtracts a TimeInterval to a Date

Â Â Â Â `Date >> DateComponents -> Date`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Adds DateComponents to a Date according to the current Calendar

Â Â Â Â `Date << DateComponents -> Date`  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Subtracts DateComponents to a Date according to the current Calendar




## General Tools

## Custom Collections

## Networking

## Property Wrappers

## Version Wizard
Shell script that synchronizes build versions and numbers across multi-scheme apps, as described in [Useradgentsâ€™ iOS Architecture Guide](about:).

### Setup
- A single mandatory user-defined Build Setting must be created: `VW_APP_ID`, which will usually be in the form `ios.<projectName>`
- Other build settings can be used to control various parts of the version wizard, they are explained directly in the `VersionWizard.sh` file
- Create a Run Script Build Phase (at the very end, after Copy Bundle Resources) named `Version Wizard`, with the following contents:

```
$(echo "$BUILD_ROOT" | sed 's%/Build/.*%%')/SourcePackages/checkouts/Slab/Helpers/VersionWizard.sh
```
- Tick the checkbox so that it runs "For install builds only"

## Environment Manager

Component that allows secure embedding of configuration keys, and easy runtime switching of environments.

A whole Xcode project demonstrating the Environment Manager is available in the [EnvTest repository](https://bitbucket.org/useradgents/envtest/src/master/)


### 1. Multi-scheme setup
Even though there's nothing preventing you from only using a Production environment and no other one, the Environment Manager only shines when used in a multi-scheme setup : one Production application, and one Dev application that allows runtime switching of environments.

To correctly setup your multi-scheme project, head over to [Useradgentsâ€™ iOS Architecture Guide](about:).

### 2. Environment Manager Setup

- Create an `Environments` directory somewhere in your project
- Add at least an `env_prod.json` file containing :

```
{
    "environment": {
        "name": "Production",
        "emoji": "ðŸŽ¢"
    },
    
    "api": {
        "baseURL": "https://mywonderfulapi.io/v1/"
        [... the rest of your configuration ...]
    },
    
    [... other groups of settings ...]
}

```

- Add a "Run Script" build phase, name it "Encrypt Environments", and ensure it runs **before** "Copy Bundle Resources". Script contents :

```
$(echo "$BUILD_ROOT" | sed 's%/Build/.*%%')/SourcePackages/checkouts/Slab/Helpers/ConfCryptor.sh
```

- add the `Environments` directory youâ€™ve just created to the scriptâ€™s Input Files, eg.

```
$(SRCROOT)/EnvTest/Environments
```

- Build the project at least once.

- If no failure is encountered, the file `env_prod.json.aes` will be created along `env_prod.json`. Add it to the Project Navigator.
	- Select `env_prod.json`, make sure it is **not** in the Target Membership settings (you donâ€™t want your plain-text credentials in your final app bundle).
	- Select `env_prod.json.aes` and make sure it is included in the Target Membership instead.

Rinse & repeat for your other environments.

The AES files are built artifacts which are regenerated on each build, so they donâ€™t need to be tracked. Donâ€™t forget to add this line to your `.gitignore` :

```
*.json.aes
```



### 3. Usage

Again, please take inspiration from the [EnvTest repository](https://bitbucket.org/useradgents/envtest/src/master/) which implements all of this

- Instanciate an `EnvironmentManager` in your AppDelegate.
	- Production schemes donâ€™t need no particular arguments ;
	- Development schemes must pass `developmentMode: true` and an optional `onChange` closure that will be called when the app restarts on a different environment than before (for clearing caches, disconnecting the user, â€¦)
	- If the initializer throws an error, thereâ€™s something wrong with the setup in the previous section.

- To retreive settings for the current environment, use:

```
let env = try EnvironmentManager()
[...]
let baseURL = env.url(forKey: "api.baseURL")
```

Other methods include `string(forKey:)`, `bool(forKey:)`, `value(forKey:)`.

- To allow selecting another environment in Development schemes, iterate over `env.all` which lists all the available environments as an array of `Environment` structs. Equality to `env.current` can be tested to provide a checkmark for the currently-selected environment.
- To make another environment active, call its `activate()` method. This will force-sync the UserDefaults and force-quit the app with a call to `exit()` â€” which are methods that will get you a rejection from Apple if you call them in production code (even though they are not private API).
